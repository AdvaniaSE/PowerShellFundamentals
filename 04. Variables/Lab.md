# Lab 04. Variables

- Find your username in an environment variable

- Find a command to get today's date and store it in the variable `$Today`
  - Examine the variable `$Today` and see how it looks
  - Find one or more methods you can use to display the date in a different format
  - Check the type of the variable and its properties and methods
  - Using a command, get the variable `$Today`. Notice the output and the difference from looking at the variable directly

- Create a list of colours, containing at least three different ones
  - Pick one of the colours and find it in the list
  - Find a way to add another colour to the list
  - Try it using different type of lists or collections, such as
    - Arrays
    - Hashtables

- Create an explicitly typed variable of type `[int]` and set a value to it
  - Try to set the value of the variable to a string instead
  - Change the `$ErrorActionPreference` variable to `SilentlyContinue`
  - Try again to set the value of the `[int]` type variable to a string and notice the difference
  - Verify the value of the variable

- Use VSCode to save these commands in a file called MyLabFile.ps1 in the folder you created in [Lab 3](../03.%20Commands%20and%20Methods/Lab.md).
