## Lab 04. Variables

- Find your username in an environment variable

- Find a command to get todays date and store it in the variable `$today`
  - Expand the variable `$today` and see how the output looks.
  - Find one or more method(s) you can use to change the output of the variable to some other format.
  - Check the type of the variable and its properties and methods.
  - Using a CmdLet, try to get the variable `today`. Notice the output, and the difference from expanding a variable.

- Create a list of colours, containing at least three different ones. Pick one colour to output from the list.
  - Find a way to add one more colour to the list
  - Try it using different type of lists, such as
    - Array
    - Hashtable
    - List\<t>

- Create an explicitly typed variable of type [int] and add a value to it.
  - Try to set the value of the [int] type variable to a string instead
  - Change the $ErrorActionPreference variable to 'SilentlyContinue'
  - Try again to set the value of the [int] type variable to a string and notice the difference
  - Verify the value of the variable.

- Use VSCode to save these commands in a file called MyLabFile.ps1 in the folder you created in [lab  3](../03.%20Commands%20and%20Methods/Lab.md) - `Find a command to use and create a folder called "MyLabFiles". Remember the path to it.`
