# Lab 01. Running Commands

Try running some different commands in the PowerShell console.

See if you can find some common parameters in different commands, and how they can be used.

One way to show available parameters in PowerShell is by using "tab completion". In the PowerShell console, type the following command including the dash `-`:

```PowerShell
Get-ChildItem -
```

Then in Windows, press the 'tab' key to scroll through available parameters, or in Linux or OSX press 'tab' twice for a list of available parameters.

Some examples of commands to explore:

- `Get-Help`
- `Get-ChildItem`
- `Get-Command`
- `Get-Verb`
- `Get-ComputerInfo`
- `Set-Location`
- `Get-Location`
