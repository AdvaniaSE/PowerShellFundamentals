# Lab 09. Wrap up and clean up

By now you should have a folder with two files:

- One CSV file containing user data
- One ps1 file containing the code to create, read, update, and format this data

Create two new ps1 files:

- AddUserData.ps1
- GetUserData.ps1

Use the code from the ps1 file to separate the get and the read processes into the two scripts

Here are a couple of examples of how you can use this flow:

- Replace the contents of the CSV files with user, password, and employee ID and use it to create AD users.
- Replace the contents with computer information to have a inventory system

The following course - [PowerShell Advanced Fundamentals](https://github.com/AdvaniaSE/PowerShellAdvancedFundamentals) - starts up where this course ends, and we will expand on the functionality started in this course, with deeper concepts such as:

- Using the code to create a reusable module
- Implementing functions with parameters and input validation
- Writing tests to verify the behavior we expect
- Adding proper error handling
- **...and much more!**

We hope to see you there!
