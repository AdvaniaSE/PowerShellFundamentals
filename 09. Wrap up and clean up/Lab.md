# Lab 09. Wrap up and clean up

By now you should have a folder with two files:

- One CSV file containing user data
- One ps1 file containing the code you created to create, read, update, and format this data.

Create two new ps1 files

- AddUserData.ps1
- GetUserData.ps1

and using the code from the ps1 one file to separate the get and the read processes.

Here are some examples of how you can use this flow:

```Text
- Replace the contents of the CSV files with user, password, and employee ID and use it to create AD users.
- Replace the contents with computer information to have a inventory system
```

The followup course - [PowerShell Advanced Fundamentals](https://github.com/AdvaniaSE/PowerShellAdvancedFundamentals) - starts up where this course ends, and we will, for example:

- Rebuild this code to a reusable module with aditional functionality
- Write tests to verify the behaviour we expect
- Add proper error handling

And much much more.

We hope to see you there!
